<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Food Product Pumps Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive-Displacement</li><li>Centrifugal</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The food product pumps market can be categorized into two primary types: positive-displacement pumps and centrifugal pumps. Positive-displacement pumps move fluid by trapping a fixed amount and forcing it through the outlet, making them ideal for handling viscous products like sauces and pastes. In contrast, centrifugal pumps utilize rotational energy to move fluids, excelling with low-viscosity liquids such as water and juices. Each type caters to specific processing needs in the food industry, ensuring efficient and reliable fluid transfer.</p></p>
