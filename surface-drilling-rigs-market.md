<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Surface Drilling Rigs Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Top-Hammer</li><li>Down-the-Hole</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Surface drilling rigs primarily include two main market types: Top-Hammer and Down-the-Hole (DTH) drilling. Top-Hammer rigs use a percussion drill bit driven by a hammer located above the hole, ideal for relatively softer rock formations. DTH rigs, on the other hand, feature a hammer that operates at the bottom of the hole, providing efficient drilling in harder rock. Each type is favored for specific geological conditions, influencing their applications in mining, construction, and exploration projects.</p></p>
