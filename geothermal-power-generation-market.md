<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Geothermal Power Generation Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Back Pressure</li><li>Binary</li><li>Double Flash</li><li>Dry Steam</li><li>Single Flash</li><li>Triple Flash</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Geothermal power generation encompasses various market types based on the technology used to convert geothermal energy into electricity. Back pressure systems utilize steam directly to drive turbines, while Binary plants transfer heat to a secondary fluid with lower boiling points for turbine operation. Dry steam plants harness steam directly from geothermal reservoirs. Single flash systems release steam from high-pressure reservoirs, and double and triple flash systems further extract steam by reducing pressure in stages for increased efficiency. Each type offers unique advantages in efficiency and resource utilization.</p></p>
