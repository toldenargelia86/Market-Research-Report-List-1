<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Road Llighting Fixtures Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-Cut-Off Luminaire</li><li>Semi-Cut-Off Luminaire</li><li>Full-Cut-Off Luminaire</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The road lighting fixtures market is categorized into three main types: non-cut-off, semi-cut-off, and full-cut-off luminaires. Non-cut-off luminaires emit light in all directions, offering broader illumination but potentially contributing to light pollution. Semi-cut-off luminaires direct light downward while allowing some lateral emission, striking a balance between visibility and minimizing glare. Full-cut-off luminaires restrict light output to a strict downward angle, reducing skyglow and enhancing night sky visibility, making them ideal for environmentally sensitive areas.</p></p>
