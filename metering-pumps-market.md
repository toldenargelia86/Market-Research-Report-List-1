<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Metering Pumps Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Diaphragm Pumps</li><li>Piston/ Plunger Pumps</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The metering pumps market includes two primary types: diaphragm pumps and piston/plunger pumps. Diaphragm pumps use a flexible membrane to create variable flow rates, offering precise dosing while preventing leakage, making them ideal for corrosive and viscous fluids. In contrast, piston/plunger pumps utilize a reciprocating mechanism to generate high-pressure flow and are suitable for high-viscosity fluids and applications requiring high accuracy. Both types are vital across industries such as chemical processing, water treatment, and pharmaceuticals for accurate fluid handling.</p></p>
